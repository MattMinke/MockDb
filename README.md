# MockDb
MockDb is a set of services for unit testing data access code that depends on ADO.Net interfaces and classes. This is beneficial for testing classes with data access that would otherwise be difficult to test.

# Why
Using tools like Dapper, PetaPoco, and Massive gives you the ability to quickly create a data access components but it can sometime be difficult to unit test code containing data access. This project aims to provide a set of classes and methods that will allow you to easily test your code that contains data access.
